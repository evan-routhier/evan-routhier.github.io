### Current Projects and Research

**Malagasy dietary mercury exposure**\
Working with Dr. Elsie Sunderland and Dr. Chris Golden, we are investigating/
the dietary sources of mercury for two populations of people who display distinct/
dietary patterns. Dietary sources  and toxicokinetics of mercury are determined via dietary surveys,/
exposure models and isotope mixing models. We are further investigating the impact gut microbiome/
has on Hg toxicokinetics.

**Mercury in the Rio Negro, Brazil**\
With Dr. Sunderland, Dr. Scot Martin, and Dr. Sergio Duvoisin Junior, we am investigating the sources/
of mercury to Amazonian rivers and pathways for methylation within these rivers.
